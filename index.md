I was formerly a computer science major here at CSUF, until changing to go into business. I expect to graduate in four years!


## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

Lab 5, part 1: In this lab we calculated the area of a rectangle. We also converted the feet to iches and converted it to other types of integers. I enjoyed this lab because it taught us how to do certain unit conversions
and I had a good time coding it overall. It helped me further my thinking and forced me to think outside the box.

Lab 4, part 2: I enjoyed this part of lab 4 because for part 2 we got to code a game. It diversified my knowledge and encouraged me to continue coding when I got discouraged. It was about guessing a secret number and even though it
seemed fairly simplistic it was fun in the end. I appreciated this part of the lab and I hope for future labs that people may get more game related coding projects. 

Lab 2, part 1: I think I enjoyed this lab the most. It was easy and simplistic and it encouraged me and my lab partner to keep working even when we thought some aspects of the lab was challenging. We even kept formatting until we 
saw that it was absolutely perfect. After we completed this lab we felt a very good sense of relief and a weight lifted off of our shoulders. It made us look forward to the future labs and what was to come.
